# Go Color Transfer

Transcolor is a simple color transfer library implemented according [whitepaper](https://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~turkel/imagepapers/ColorTransfer.pdf).
That is pure Go implementation using https://github.com/lucasb-eyer/go-colorful to switch between color spaces.

Library is currently in Beta, so no benchmarks, optimizations, tests, or anything else unfortunately. I will improve this lib according to issues and personal needs

## Example

An [example](./examples/transfer/main.go) and a program to provide simple color transfering.

Use `./run.sh` script to see it in action, or compile and use for your own personal needs.
