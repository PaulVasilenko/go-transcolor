# Go Color Transfer

[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/PaulVasilenko/go-transcolor)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/PaulVasilenko/go-transcolor)

Transcolor is a simple color transfer library implemented according [whitepaper](https://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~turkel/imagepapers/ColorTransfer.pdf).

That is pure Go implementation using https://github.com/lucasb-eyer/go-colorful to switch between color spaces.

Library is currently in Beta, so no benchmarks, optimizations, tests, or anything else unfortunately. I will improve this lib according to issues and personal needs
